# HOUSE PREDICTION
## Overview
We work for Hass Consulting Company, a real estate expert with over 25 years of experience, as Data Scientists. We've been given the duty of researching the elements that influence housing prices utilizing data on real estate properties gathered over the last few months.

Given the data, we are to create a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on the features given in the dataset provided.

House demand is increasing in the real estate business. Housing costs vary depending on a variety of factors such as location, property type, and living square footage. It would be beneficial for a Real Estate Company to understand how to decide which properties perform well in a market based on the elements that influence these pricing. This will allow them to price their homes appropriately and may also provide insight into how the properties' worth may increase in the future. Consumers would be able to access this data if they so desired.
